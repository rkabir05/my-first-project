					<p> The sporty Jaguar MK II was built from 1959 to 1967 and is prized for its elegance, performance and luxury. It had advanced technology and, above all, powerful in-line six-cylinder engines. The car for sale was delivered new in Switzerland in the very rare color "opalescent bronze". The last owner acquired the car in 1988 and restored it down to the last screw from 2000-2002. Great importance was attached to originality and perfect work was carried out down to the smallest detail. </p>

					<p> enthusiastic about bread, what is there not to love about encrusted chewy softness filled with carbs? But sourdough has such a unique process that is completely dependent on where it is in its environment. Depending on what yeast and bacteria are in a kitchen every sourdough is not created equal. A sourdough in San Francisco has a very distinguished flavor that is different from anywhere else. Besides where you are in the world it also depends on the baker.  </p>
